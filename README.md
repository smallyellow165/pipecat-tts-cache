# Pipecat TTS Cache: Zero-Latency Audio Synthesis

**Pipecat TTS Cache** is a lightweight caching layer for the Pipecat ecosystem. It transparently wraps existing TTS services to eliminate API costs for repeated phrases and reduce response latency to **<5ms**.

> **See it in action:** [Watch the Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jZRZVPNVrcrbslyKDRhww2qEXkj29b9F/view?usp=sharing)

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Ultra-Low Latency** – Delivers cached audio in ~0.1ms (Memory) or ~1-5ms (Redis).
- **Local Persistence** – Disk backend keeps cached responses across process/server restarts, without Redis.
- **Cost Reduction** – Stop paying your TTS provider for common phrases like "Hello," "One moment," or "I didn't catch that."
- **Universal Compatibility** – Works as a Mixin with **all** Pipecat TTS services (Cartesia, ElevenLabs, Deepgram, Google, etc.).
- **Smart Interruption** – Automatically clears pending cache tasks and resets state when users interrupt the bot.
- **Precision Alignment** – Preserves word-level timestamps for perfect lip-syncing and subtitles, even on cached replays.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Standard installation (Memory and Disk backends)
pip install pipecat-tts-cache

# Production installation (with Redis support)
pip install "pipecat-tts-cache[redis]"

```

## 🧩 Service Compatibility

The mixin works with **any** Pipecat `TTSService` — HTTP or WebSocket. It captures audio as it
flows through the pipeline (keyed by Pipecat's per-request audio context) and replays cached audio
back through that same audio context, so playback ordering is preserved even when cache hits and
live synthesis are mixed in a single turn.

How much detail is preserved on a cache hit depends on what the underlying service produces:

| **What the service emits** | **What is cached & replayed** | **Providers (examples)** |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Word timestamps** | Audio **plus** word-level timestamps → `TTSTextFrame`s are regenerated on replay, so transcripts and word alignment stay correct (even on interruption). | Cartesia, Rime, ElevenLabs, Hume |
| **Audio only** | The full audio response is cached and replayed; transcript text is preserved via the framework's own text frames. | Google, OpenAI, Deepgram, Sarvam |

> Since Pipecat `1.0`, word-timestamp support lives on the base `TTSService`, so provider class
> names are no longer meaningful for caching — the mixin adapts to whatever each service emits at
> runtime.

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Basic In-Memory Cache (Development)

The `MemoryCacheBackend` is perfect for local development or single-process bots. It uses an LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy.

```python
from pipecat_tts_cache import TTSCacheMixin, MemoryCacheBackend
from pipecat.services.google.tts import GoogleHttpTTSService

# 1. Create a cached class using the Mixin
class CachedGoogleTTS(TTSCacheMixin, GoogleHttpTTSService):
    pass

# 2. Initialize with memory backend
tts = CachedGoogleTTS(
    settings=CachedGoogleTTS.Settings(voice="en-US-Chirp3-HD-Charon"),
    cache_backend=MemoryCacheBackend(max_size=1000),
    cache_ttl=86400,  # Cache for 24 hours
)

```

### 2. Distributed Redis Cache (Production)

For production deployments, use `RedisCacheBackend`. This allows the cache to persist across restarts and be shared among multiple bot instances.

```python
from pipecat_tts_cache.backends import RedisCacheBackend

tts = CachedGoogleTTS(
    settings=CachedGoogleTTS.Settings(voice="en-US-Chirp3-HD-Charon"),
    cache_backend=RedisCacheBackend(
        redis_url="redis://localhost:6379/0",
        key_prefix="pipecat:tts:",
    ),
    cache_ttl=604800, # Cache for 1 week
)

```

> ⚠️ **Security — Redis trust boundary.** The Redis backend serializes cached audio with
> `pickle`, so it must be treated as trusted: use a **single-tenant, authenticated,
> network-isolated** Redis instance. Never point it at a shared/untrusted Redis — anyone who
> can write the keyspace could achieve code execution when an entry is read. See `SECURITY.md`.
>
> **Backend lifecycle.** You own the backend you pass in — reuse a single instance across
> sessions (recommended for Redis, so its connection pool is shared) and call
> `await backend.close()` when your app shuts down. The package never closes an injected
> backend, so a shared one is safe.

### 3. Persistent Disk Cache (Single Server)

`DiskCacheBackend` implements the same `CacheBackend` interface, with no extra dependencies.
Pass it to your existing cached service (the `CachedGoogleTTS` class from above):

```python
from pipecat_tts_cache import DiskCacheBackend

backend = DiskCacheBackend(cache_dir="/var/cache/my-bot/tts")
tts = CachedGoogleTTS(
    settings=CachedGoogleTTS.Settings(voice="en-US-Chirp3-HD-Charon"),
    cache_backend=backend,
    cache_namespace="my-bot",  # Stable across sessions/restarts
    cache_ttl=86400,
)
# Keep tts in your existing Pipecat pipeline, before transport.output().
# At application shutdown:
# await backend.close()  # Preserves disk entries
```

Use a writable, dedicated local directory; it is created on the first write. Reuse the
same directory, namespace, provider/settings and text after restarting to hit the cache.
Relative paths resolve at construction; an absolute path avoids dependence on the working
directory. Container deployments need a persistent mounted volume.

- **Payload:** the existing `CachedTTSResponse` fields, including chunks, audio format,
  word timestamps, creation time and metadata, stored as versioned JSON with Base64 audio
  and a SHA-256 integrity checksum. Metadata must be JSON-compatible; unsupported values
  cause `set()` to return `False`. No pickle, database, Pipecat frame or service serialization.
  The mixin supplies text/audio metadata, not credentials; custom callers must not put
  secrets in response metadata or keys. Replay creates fresh frames in the current context.
- **TTL:** absolute expiration time survives restarts. `None`, zero and negative TTL mean
  no expiry, matching Memory/Redis. Reads do not extend TTL. Expired, corrupt, unsupported
  or unreadable entries return a miss; write failures return `False` so synthesis continues.
- **Writes:** file I/O runs off the event loop. Owner-only temporary files are flushed and
  fsynced, then atomically replaced in the same directory. Readers see complete old/new
  entries; concurrent writers use last-replacement-wins semantics. Intended for local
  filesystems, not network shares; this is not a power-loss durability guarantee.
- **Maintenance:** `delete(key)`, `clear()` and `clear(namespace)` work as on other backends.
  Expired/corrupt files remain until overwritten or explicitly removed, avoiding deletion
  races with new writes. Namespace clear skips corrupt files it cannot attribute safely;
  unscoped clear removes them. There is no automatic size eviction. Stats `size` counts
  entry files (including expired/corrupt ones); hit/miss counters reset per instance.
  Clear during concurrent writes is best-effort, as with Redis. An abruptly killed writer
  may leave an ignored `.tts-cache-*.tmp` file; remove these only when writers are stopped.

**Manual check (`miss → hit → restart → hit`):** with the existing example credentials
configured, set `USE_REDIS_CACHE=false` and `DISK_CACHE_DIR=/absolute/path/to/tts-cache`,
then run `examples/basic_caching.py` as below. Use an empty directory for the first run.
Let the intro finish, ask “please repeat that”, and check the `Cache miss` / `Cache hit`
logs. Stop and restart the server with the same environment; the identical intro should
now log `Cache hit`. Keep the same voice/settings and finish within the example's 1-hour TTL.

For a storage-only check without provider credentials, run twice:

```bash
uv run python examples/disk_persistence.py /absolute/path/to/empty-cache
# First process: miss -> stored -> hit
uv run python examples/disk_persistence.py /absolute/path/to/empty-cache
# New process: hit -> hit
```

## 🧠 How It Works

The system utilizes a **Frame Interception Architecture** to seamlessly integrate with the Pipecat pipeline:

1. **Deterministic Key Gen**: Before requesting audio, a unique key is generated based on the normalized text, voice ID, model, speed, and pitch. Sensitive data (API keys) is excluded.
2. **Cache Check (`run_tts`)**:
* **Hit:** The system immediately pushes cached audio frames and timestamps to the pipeline.
* **Miss:** The system calls the parent TTS service.


3. **Collection (`push_frame`)**: As the parent service generates audio, the Mixin intercepts the frames, aggregates them, and stores them in the backend for future use.

### Interruption Handling

When an `InterruptionFrame` is received, the cache mixin immediately:

* Clears all pending cache write tasks.
* Resets the internal batch state.
* Ensures no partial or cut-off audio is committed to the pipeline.

## 📊 Management & Stats

You can monitor cache performance or clear entries programmatically.

```python
# Check performance
stats = await tts.get_cache_stats()
print(f"Hit Rate: {stats['hit_rate']:.1%}")
print(f"Total Saved Calls: {stats['hits']}")

# Maintenance
await tts.clear_cache() # Clear all
await tts.clear_cache(namespace="user_123") # Clear specific namespace

```

## ⚡ Performance

| Metric | Direct API | Memory Cache | Redis Cache |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Latency** | 200ms - 1500ms | **~0.1ms** | **~2ms** |
| **Cost** | $ per character | **$0** | **$0** |
| **Consistency** | Variable | Deterministic | Deterministic |
